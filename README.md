Some notebooks I'm working on in Google Colab


##readme

These notebooks were created by Logan Zoellner (@nagolinc, https://loganzoellner.com)


many of these notebooks make use of @AydaoAI's "This Anime Does not exist" (which you can read more about here: https://www.gwern.net/Faces#extended-stylegan2-danbooru2019-aydao) and CLIP (which you can read more about here https://github.com/openai/CLIP).

Much of it was based off of this notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/github/openai/clip/blob/master/Interacting_with_CLIP.ipynb created by @openai
